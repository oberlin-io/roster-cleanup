Case converting and first/last name transposing

As a teacher, some of the rosters I get from an administration are not exactly easy to digest.

For example:

* SALEH ALSHEHRI, SALEH S.
* MOHAMMED ALZAHRANI, NAWAF A.
* ULLAH MAHMOOD, MUATH D.
* A MORSHID, AHMAD R.
* M ALHARTHI, MOHANNAD S.

Quickly identifying the students' first names, out of a list of 30 some students, during a lesson is difficult.

Better to transpose around the comma and fix the casing while we're at it.
